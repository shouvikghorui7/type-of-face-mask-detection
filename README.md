# type-of-face-mask-detection
Facial mask detection is a significant computer vision problem aimed at identifying whether individuals are wearing face masks in images or videos. In this project, we propose a deep learning solution using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet version 2 architecture to tackle this task.
